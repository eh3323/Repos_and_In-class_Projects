Here are some meaningful projects that I have done so far. I'll list brief descriptions for each of the projects down below. Codes in detail can be viewed in corresponding files.
1. DL_proj

This is just a really classical image identification, specifically cloth identification, reproduction that I have done to deepen my understanding toward deep learning and how exactly it works on code. Through this project I learned some technical skills on Pytorch. 

2. CSCI-UA 472 proj1

I Write two programs that solves the Best Independent Set problem. I used two approaches: The first used iterative deepening; The second used simple hill climbing with random restart.
The “Best Independent Set” problem is defined as follows:
Input: An undirected graph G, in which each vertex is marked by a positive value ;
and a target value T.
Goal: A set of vertices S such that (a) no two vertices in S are connected by an edge
in G; and (b) the total value of the vertices in S is at least T.
For instance, in Graph 1 below, with T = 16, there are three solutions:
{ C,D }, { A,E }, and { B,E }.
In Graph 2, with T = 16 there are two solutions: { G,H,K } and { H,I }.

3. CSCI-UA 472 puzzle_solving

Used Davis-Putnam algorithm to to solve a generalization of the 15 puzzle, or sliding puzzle. Specifically, each element of the puzzle is transfered into the propositional calculus and using a SAT-solver.
