CSCI-UA 472
Programming Assignment 4
Erfu Hai

I uploaded 1 py file for the question, named hmk4.py.
Use python 3 in the terminal, and locate the place where you save these py files. 
Then run the following command in your terminal:
python3 hmk4.py (your input file name).txt N(training set)

PS: make sure to make all of my files in the SAME FOLDER, so that it can make sure it can open the words.txt file I uploaded. Otherwise, MAKE SURE TO NAME the key word file TO BE words.txt

If having any other questions running my code, please contact my email eh3323@nyu.edu. I will reply as soon as possible to assit for running my homework

Here is an example of my running:
